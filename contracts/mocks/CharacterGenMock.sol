// Mocked endpoint for all of the basic distro flows
// In production this will be three seperate contracts, so build accordingly.
// This contract is simply meant to provide a clean mocked version of the primary endpointss
// needed for the basic distribution apps. Some functions _may_ change slightly, but generally
// integrating based on these mocks should allow us to integrate the completed contracts with little to no friction
// and provide a more stable, modular and accesible testing option for front-end testing.
